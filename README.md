# Quick Notes App

This repository shows a sample implementation of a note taking app using a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) backend. 

The app allows the creation, editing and deletion of simple text notes. User accounts allow simple access to note data even through reinstallations or device changes. Changes made offline are automatically synced to the backend when a network connection is re-established.

The full app can be downloaded from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sreimler.quicknotes).
